# FSharp Weekly

F# Weekly is a mobile application for Android, iOS and UWP. 

Built in F# (of course) using [Fabulous](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous) and [fabulous-simple-elements](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/fabulous-simple-elements). The application [scrapes](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/fsharp-weekly/blob/master/FSharpWeekly/Scraper.fs) blog entries from [F# Weekly](https://sergeytihon.com/category/f-weekly/), extracts their associated links and renders them on the phone.
